# IE-456-Term-Project
In the scope of the project, we read the article ["A SEQUENTIAL IMPORTANCE SAMPLING ALGORITHM FOR GENERATING RANDOM GRAPHS WITH PRESCRIBED DEGREES"](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/GraphAlgorithm.pdf) by Joseph Blitzstein and Persi Diaconis and compared the proposed model with Havel-Hakimi and Configuration model in terms of run time with different types of graph instances.
